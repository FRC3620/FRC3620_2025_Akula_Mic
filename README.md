# Programming Requirnements
* Mechanisms
  * Eleveator 
    * 2 stage - 2 Krakens.
    * Motors linked by belts.
    * Hard stop/limit switch
  * Shoulder+arm(Algae+Coral)
    * 1 Kraken for the Shoulder(restraints to not break robot)(Shoulder)
    * 1 Neo for the the belts to hold algae(Arm)
    * Absolute encoder on the pivot
    * Sensor on arm to identify coral
    * Manual controls
  * Climber
    * 1 motor back and forth(Like ground intake) 
    * Absolute Encoder
    * both manual and set position
    * Algae ground intake(Not huge priority)
    * 1 kraken swinging up and down(pivot)
    * 1 550 spining wheels
    * Absolute encoders
    * Hardstop back
    * set positions
* Cameras
    * 1 on coral pickup side
    * 1 on desposit side
    * Has to be very precise
    * How do we manage to keep it consistent in the long-term?
