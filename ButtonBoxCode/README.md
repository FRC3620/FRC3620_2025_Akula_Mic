These code files and libraries are for CircuitPython v9.

The Adafruit libraries were taken from adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-9.x-mpy-20250224 (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases)

joystick_xl is from joystick_xl_0.4.3_cp9 (https://github.com/fasteddy516/CircuitPython_JoystickXL)

Doug doesn't remember where he got the keybow2040.py; it may have come loaded on the device. If it needs updating, looks like https://github.com/pimoroni/keybow2040-circuitpython/tree/master/lib would be the place to get a updated version.
